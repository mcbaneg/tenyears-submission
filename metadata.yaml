# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "A calculation of interaction virial coefficients for the hydrogen-carbon monoxide system has been reproduced successfully.  The main calculation is a set of nested quadratures.  The program, written in Fortran, uses IQPACK routines for quadrature weights and nodes, BLAS routines for vector manipulation, and a dedicated subsystem to evaluate the potential energy as a function of molecular coordinates. Only very minor modifications to the main code were required to run it on a modern machine."
